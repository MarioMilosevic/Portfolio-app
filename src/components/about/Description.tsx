        I am a frontend developer from Montenegro currently living in Serbia who
        is passionate about creating user-friendly web experiences, skilled in
        React, Vue, Node, Next and TypeScript, and focusing on building
        responsive and modern web applications. Ovo je neka promjena koju sam

        Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games, watching TV shows, staying
        active through working out and cycling, and constantly striving for

        discipline.
